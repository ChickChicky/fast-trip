# FAST-TRIP

It was a long way here, just starting from intricate patterns that form when you put sand on top of a metal plate you try to play like a violin with its bow. Somewhere along the line it turned into a weird image generation thing that was slow as hell.

This project was actually really suited for shaders, and it of course outpassed any prior iterations.

# Quick start

* Install [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/)
* Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/)
* Run `npm install`
* Run `node index.js`
* Open *renderer.html*

You should now see the video play on the page and once it stops, it should have finished creating a video file in the same directory.

You can try to edit the shader directly inside the .html file, but I'll try to make a bit more friendly interface for doing so in the future.
